# teatrical

This project is my first web project created at 2015.

This project was intended to be the website and content manager for my theater team at that moment.

We were able to have copies of our:
- technical books
- screenplays
- videos
- audios (sound effects and music for the plays)

My connection to this project is really personal, because it was the first time for many things like:
- Understanding what is a server.
- Using Linux as a server and as a desktop S.O.
- Responsive design.
- Connection to MySql databases.
- Learnt PHP as a programming language for the backend application.
- Sharing what I learnt with @nucleognulinux a study group at my college

Most of my learning process came from [w3schools.com](w3schools.com)
